Sending 1000 phone messages at a time can be a complex task that typically requires the use of specialized software or a third-party service provider.
There are a few free and paid options available online that you can use to send bulk text messages. Here are a few examples:

**Twilio**: Twilio is a cloud communications platform that offers an API for programmable messaging. With Twilio, you can send SMS messages to phone numbers in over 180 countries. Twilio offers a free trial that includes $15.50 in credit, which you can use to send text messages.

**TextNow**: TextNow is a free texting and calling app that allows you to send SMS messages to US and Canadian phone numbers. TextNow offers a free plan that includes unlimited texting and calling, although you may see ads in the app.

It's important to note that sending unsolicited text messages (also known as spam) is illegal in many countries, including the US and Canada. Make sure that you have permission to send text messages to your recipients, and provide an option to unsubscribe from future messages. Additionally, consider the frequency and timing of your messages to avoid annoying or overwhelming your recipients.
